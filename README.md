## About Me

I'm a former Electrical Technologist with 5+ years of experience in the healthcare industry (Abbott Point of Care), now transitioning into the world of **Data Analytics and Data Science**.

My journey is driven by curiosity, a passion for optimization, and a commitment to continuous learning. I've earned multiple DataCamp certifications (SQL Associate, Data Analyst Associate, and in progress: Data Engineer Associate), and I’m using this foundation to build real-world, data-driven solutions across domains like sports analytics, manufacturing, and public health.
